Hello NAME,

I am Aravind Machiry, Assistant Professor at Purdue's ECE Department.

We noticed that you are one of the owners or maintainers of PROJECT debian project.

We want to understand whether you are using any Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools (i.e., static checkers) as part of your project and if not then want to understand any challenges in using them.

We are conducting a short anonymous survey (~2min) for this.

Survey Link: https://purdue.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bsjJScol1rUHzhA

As a participant, you will be asked to answer a few questions related to the use of SAST tools in your project.

Your participation will greatly help in improving the security of Debian software ecosystem.

However, participation is voluntary and required to be atleast 18 years old.

- Thank you,
  Aravind Machiry
